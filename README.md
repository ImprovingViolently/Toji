# What is TojiBot?

TojiBot is a simple Discord bot I put together out of sheer boredom.

# How do I set up TojiBot?

1. Install discord.py.
2. Create a Discord application, using a relevant name.
3. Go to OAuth2 > URL Generator, select 'bot' as the scope, and assign relevant permissions.
4. Use the link generated to invite the bot to your server.
5. Locate token within config.py, and replace with your own Discord bot token.
6. Run bot.py.

This project uses discord.py. More information can be found @ https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py
